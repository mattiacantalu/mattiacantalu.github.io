"""
    My name is Mattia Cantalù and I come from Italy. I attended the University of Modena "E. Ferrari", where I conferred a bachelor degree in Computer Engineering.
    In 2011, I also studied at the University of Pisa, where I received a certificate as Apple iOS Developer.

    I'm a Senior iOS Developer at YOOX NET-A-PORTER Group, the global Internet retailing partner for leading fashion and luxury brands, developing YOOX official app.

    My expertise allows me to lead the iOS team and performs all my daily activities following Agile methodology: sprints and ceremonies.
    Managing the iOS activities, releases and deadlines are my very first goals, ensuring the team is capable to work in a sane environment achieving the requests made.

    I’m a great admirer of clean code, functional programming and SOLID principles; the experience with VIPER Architecture, protocol oriented pattern and unit tests complete my iOS background.

    I’m a reliables person and my personality is focused to achieve the objectives set.
    I’m always looking for new challenges, because they are the one makes you grow.

    Before join YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP I spent a few years as freelancer iOS Developer: I've developed some personal, enterprise and commercial applications for many companies in Italy.

    During my leisure time I love travel all over the world but I’m deep admirer of London and its English culture.
    Passion for tech and Apple addicted; sport is my guide.
    I speak Italian (native language) and English.
